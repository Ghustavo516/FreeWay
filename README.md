# FreeWay

FreeWay is an exhilarating game inspired by the classic Freeway from the Atari 2600. In the game, your mission is to guide a friendly little cow across the street to rack up points. Similar to the original game, the speed of the cars increases with each point earned, providing an increasingly challenging gaming environment. Enjoy yourself as you face the growing intensity and test your skills while crossing the street with the cow!
